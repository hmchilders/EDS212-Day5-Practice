4 == 4



```

```{r}

4 != 5

4 != 4


```

```{r}
#Does 4 match "4"

4 == "4"


```

```{r}
#Can assigned variables match?
cat <- 4
dog <- 6

cat == dog
cat >= dog

#Is dog greater than cat or less than 20?
dog >cat | cat<20
```

```{r}
#Is dog less than cat and cat ==10
dog<cat & cat == 10

dog < cat & cat > 2 & 4 >= dog
```
